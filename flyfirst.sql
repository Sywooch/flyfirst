The advent of business class air travel mirrors the growth of the global economy, creating a level of travel that offers far greater comfort and service than economy class. While not as expensive as&#160;<a href="http://www.iflyfirstclass.com/" target="_blank" title="cheap business class to asia">f</a>irst class, business class air fares can still be a bit pricey.</p>\n\n    <p>The business and first class travel experts at FlyFirst(FF) want business and pleasure travelers to know that, with a little ingenuity and planning, business class fares are within reach for a variety of budgets. Here are a few of their tips for getting the best deals on business class travel:</p>\n\n    <p>Book in advance. The on-demand pricing structure of many airlines means that the earlier seats are booked, the better the pricing. Booking airfares one to two months ahead of time can translate to savings of up to 60 percent on many airlines. Now is a perfect time to start searching for, and booking, business class flights for late spring and early summer.</p>\n\n    <p>Be flexible. Just as with coach airfare, travelers willing to fly overnight, very early in the morning or on quieter days will realize the best savings. The benefits of business class are even more apparent on those red-eye flights, since travelers have more travel room and seats that are more suitable for sleeping.</p>\n\n    <p>Travel off-season. For business class, off-season is summertime when business slows down a bit to accommodate summer vacations and holidays. &quot;Particularly in Europe, where August is the sacred holiday month, business class capacity is often wide open in summer,&quot; advises Julia Graft, PR manager for FF. &quot;The abundance of seats makes summer a great time to travel via business class, especially if the travel is for a pleasure vacation.&quot;</p>\n\n    <p>Take advantage of unsold seats.Business Class&#160;seats are very infrequently sold out, and those unsold seats often can be purchased at discounted prices, called Y-Up fares. Travelers can call the airlines or an airline booking service and ask for available Y-Up fares. These discounts are especially helpful if travel arrangements are being planned in less than 30 days.</p>\n\n    <p>Use frequent flier miles. Often, business class travel is less expensive when using frequent flier miles to supplement an unrestricted coach fare. Travelers can purchase an unrestricted ticket in economy/coach class, then call the airline to ask for an upgrade using mile credits obtained through rewards programs or credit card programs. Before committing to this method, however, travelers should check out the other options to determine the best pricing available.</p>\n\n    <p>Use a discount travel booking service. Travel experts&#160;like those at FF have years of experience in negotiating and unearthing the very best deals on business class travel. Using such a service can save travelers loads of time and money and pave the way for a hassle-free travel experience.</p>\n\n    <p>Whether travelers are flying across the world for business or across a continent for a family vacation, business class can offer the perfect combination of comfort and affordability. &quot;Using these FlyFirst tips, we are certain travelers can find reasonably priced business class airfares to suit their individual budgets,&quot; Graft concludes.</p>\n\n    <p>&#160;</p>\n\n    <p>&#160;</p>\n', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

To help air passengers pinpoint the best airport for their own upcoming travels, the business class and first class&#160;travel experts at FlyFirst discuss the 2012&#39;s 10 Busiest Airports in the World, based on preliminary statistics compiled by the Airports Council International.</p>\n\n    <p>For more than a decade, the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has been the world&#39;s busiest airport, and is expected to retain its No. 1 spot in 2012. From January to November in 2012, the airport handled the enplanement and deplanement of more than 88 million passengers, an increase of 3.3 percent over 2011. In spite of its tremendous passenger volume, Atlanta&#39;s airport earns high marks in on-time measurements. The airport infrequently experiences flight cancellations, at a rate of a little more than half of one percent.</p>\n\n    <p>&#8220;We urge travelers not to automatically avoid busy airports,&#8221; says Julia Graft, FF PR manager. &#8220;Airports like Atlanta&#39;s can sometimes offer more available routes and capacity and may be more efficient than smaller, regional airports.&#8221;</p>\n\n    <p>China&#39;s Beijing Capital International Airport is a distant second to Atlanta with 75 million passengers from January to November, 2012. It will likely retain its No. 2 ranking in 2012, experiencing a 4.3 percent increase in passenger traffic. A bustling hub for Air China, the airport earned high marks in customer service in 2011, placing third in the Airports Council International&#39;s Airport Service Quality Awards.</p>\n\n    <p>London&#39;s Heathrow Airport and Chicago&#39;s O&#39;Hare International Airport will likely end 2012 at third and fourth places, respectively. Heathrow handled more than 64 million passengers during the first 11 months of 2012. Its entire network of six London-area airports is consistently ranked as the busiest airport system in the world. O&#39;Hare&#39;s traffic is relatively close to Heathrow&#39;s, with 62 million passengers during the 11-month period. O&#39;Hare&#39;s growth for the year was small, at just under one percent.</p>\n\n    <p>Tokyo international airport in Japan experienced a stellar 8.1 percent increase in the first 11 months of 2012, with nearly 62 million passengers in the first 11 months of 2012. The airport has ranked fifth on the list each year since 2009.</p>\n\n    <p>The only airport new to the preliminary Top 10 list is Indonesia&#39;s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport at No. 10. &quot;The airport has steadily risen in the rankings over the past few years, placing 12th in 2011 and 16th in 2010,&quot; notes Graft. &quot;Its 15.6 percent increase in passenger traffic is significant and makes it an airport to watch in the coming months.&quot;</p>\n\n    <p>Here are the preliminary rankings for the 10 busiest airports in the world for January to November, 2012:&#160;<br />\n    10. Indonesia Soekarno-Hatta International Airport &ndash; 52.6 million passengers&#160;<br />\n    9. Frankfurt Airport, Germany &ndash; 53.5 million passengers&#160;<br />\n    8.

The service is exquisite, including a 10-course meal with caviar and free-flowing champagne. The seats are equally impressive with generous storage space, a personal television and seats that extend to full-flat beds for long overnight flights.</p>\n\n    <p>U.S.-based carriers infrequently attain a spot on these first class lists, but FF likes American Airlines relatively new swivel seats. The first in the industry to offer swivel seating, American Airlines&#39; seats recline to a 6&#39;6&#8221; full-flat bed, and the seat&#39;s two drop-down arm rests provide extra space. The seats operate electronic reclining and lumbar support for additional on-board comfort.</p>\n\n    <p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Lufthansa&#39;s First Class cabins include spacious leather seats that convert to full-flat beds. The airline&#39;s 747 aircraft offer first class passengers both a seat that converts to the bed and a chair so that travelers can visit with one another or just spread out. Cabin humidifiers are a nice touch, as are the fine dining options.</span></p>\n\n    <p>First class passengers have more room to spread out and enjoy a little privacy aboard Cathay Pacific. The airline only installs six to nine first class seats on any airplane, in a 1x1x1 configuration. &#8220;That limited seating translates into more personal space and less aisle traffic,&#8221; Graft says. The airline, known for its first class service, offers all the usual first class amenities as well, including a personal television monitor, storage space and plenty of champagne.</p>\n\n    <p>Aboard Emirates&#39; Airbus 380, first class seats are actually private suites with full-flat beds and turn-down service. The on-board showers nicely complement other amenities and in-flight entertainment system that always receives top marks from passengers.</p>\n\n    <p>FF enjoys Etihad&#39;s push-button control seats that lie fully flat at an impressive 6&#39;8&#8221; and Malaysia Air&#39;s comfortable seats/beds, top-notch linens, toiletries and soft pajamas. Rounding out the list of the top 10 first class seats are <a href="http://www.iflyfirstclass.com/" target="_blank" title="cheap business class with Singapore air">Singapore Airlines</a>, Qantas, and Jet Airways. Singapore Airlines&#39; Airbus 380 first class seats are leather and span 35 inches across. Situated in individual pods, the seats offer privacy and large television monitors. Qantas&#39; provides very large seats with plenty of privacy, ample storage and a plush sheepskin underpaid for sleeping. Jet Airways&#39; first class seating includes excellent in-flight entertainment, comfortable flat beds and sliding privacy screens.</p>\n\n    <p>For information about other first class seating options, contact the business and first class travel experts at FF by calling 888-347-7817&#160;</p>\n', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

FlyFirst, a leading luxury travel booking service, advises travelers for business and pleasure to schedule their summer trips now, before the peak of the season is underway. To help consumers save on summer travel,&#160;<a href="http://www.flyfirst.com/" target="_blank" title="Cheap Business Class Flights">FlyFirst offers</a>&#160;its four top tips for making the most of a travel budget during the peak season.</p>\n\n    <p>Research the destination. Tens of millions of U.S. travelers use the Internet to research their travel accommodations each year. Prospective travelers should put the power of the Internet to use in researching the destination and getting a feel for which summer months are the least expensive. Travel to and from China, for example, is rapidly increasing, and demand for seats on those flights is growing as well. In August, though, travel to China drops off, making it the perfect time to book a trip to the country.</p>\n\n    <p>Book in advance. Many airlines use on-demand pricing, so as the available seats are reserved, the pricing increases. This increase can be avoided if travelers book their flights in advance, when there are as many seats open as possible. In addition, other airline costs, such as oil and labor, may increase as the summer progresses, so booking early may help travelers avoid those cost increases.</p>\n\n    <p>If booking well in advance isn&#39;t possible, take advantage of unsold seats in other travel classes.<a href="http://flyfirst.com/continent/asia" target="_blank" title="cheap business class flight">Business class seats</a>&#160;rarely sell out, and those open seats can be purchased at discounted Y-Up fares. So, for those who need to find a flight within the next 30 days, calling the airline or an airline booking service and asking for available Y-Up fares in business class may be the way to go.</p>\n\n    <p>&quot;Only the very savvy travelers know to ask for the Y-Up discounts,&quot; notes Julia Graft, PR manager for FlyFirst. &quot;The discounts can be considerable, and vacationers can benefit from the extra space and amenities offered by business class in the process.&quot;</p>\n\n    <p>For some countries, business travel slows down in the summer. Many European countries, for instance, virtually shut businesses during the holiday month of August. For those destinations, check the pricing of business class tickets and first class fares. Since there is often unused capacity in those classes of travel, the prices may often be more affordable than one would expect. Prices for business class flights from Los Angeles to London, for example, decrease significantly in August.</p>\n\n    <p>Take advantage of frequent flier miles, credit card miles and services that can optimize those rewards. Countless credit card companies offer travel mileage accrual on everyday purchases and offer greater flexibility on redeeming airlines. Capital One Venture Rewards Card and Chase Sapphire Preferred Card both get high marks for flexibility and reward bonuses. To maximize the accrued reward points, travelers should consider using services that know all the ins and outs of the reward systems. Award travel booking services like&#160;<a href="http://www.awardgenius.com/" target="_blank" title="save money">AwardGenius.com</a>&#160;help consumers get the most out of their accrued points.</p>\n\n    <p>With a little planning, travelers can save considerably on travel during the bustling summer season.

Get a peak at Heidi&#39;s World, tour some of the country&#39;s 1,000-plus museums or scout the 44 B.C. Roman settlement August Raurica. Take a step back in time at Stein am Rhein and its looming mountaintop Hohenklingen Castle.

To help its customers select the best airport for their upcoming summer vacations, FlyFirst, a leader in the first and business class travel industry, recently announced its projections for the summer&#39;s most active airports around the world.<br />\n    <br />\n    Topping the list as the busiest airport is Atlanta&#39;s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. &quot;For more than 12 years running, Atlanta has been the busiest airport in the world, and we expect it to remain the top airport throughout the summer,&quot; explains FlyFirst PR Manager Julia Graft. &quot;The airport is convenient to a variety of vacation spots on the country&#39;s East Coast and is a frequent transition point for U.S. travelers heading to Europe and the Middle East.&quot;<br />\n    <br />\n    Even though it handles a tremendous passenger volume, the Atlanta airport offers excellent on-time flight performance, with 82 percent of its arrivals and 84 percent of its departures adhering to schedule. Infrequent flight cancellations at Atlanta also help summer travelers keep on track.<br />\n    <br />\n    With good on-time statistics and many flight options, FlyFirst cautions travelers not to automatically avoid busy airports. &#8220;Busy airports like Atlanta usually offer greater route availability, larger capacity and swifter efficiency than their smaller regional counterparts,&#8221; Graft says.<br />\n    <br />\n    Throughout the summer, Beijing Capital International Airport in China should maintain its rank as the second busiest airport. &quot;Travel to China and the Far East is growing, Graft says, &quot;and FlyFirst expects its summertime travel statistics to remain consistently vigorous.&quot;<br />\n    <br />\n    London&#39;s system of six active airports actually makes it the world&#39;s busiest airport system, but its Heathrow Airport usually ranks at No. 3 in the list of busy international airports. Not only is London the most-visited city in the world, it offers a variety of convenient links to other vacation spots in Western Europe. Considering all of those factors, FlyFirst expects London&#39;s Heathrow Airport to maintain its spot in the top five busiest airports throughout the summer of 2013.&#160;<br />\n    <br />\n    In recent years, popular Tokyo International Airport and Chicago&#39;s O&#39;Hare International Airport round out the annual list of top five busiest airports in the world, and FlyFirst anticipates they will remain bustling sites throughout the summer.

To help Americans travel wisely, the travel experts at FlyFirst offer a few tips for traveling abroad this year.</p>\n\n    <p>Plan for airport delays. The current government sequester creates a number of cutbacks in Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Customs forces, leading to longer processing times at airports. Travelers should expect wait times for security and Customs checkpoints to double.</p>\n\n    <p>Use smart phones wisely. Travelers should check with cell phone companies to determine what roaming and other charges they may face while abroad. With a little planning, smart phone users can avoid roaming charges by unlocking their GSM-system smart phone and, while abroad, going to a local cell phone store to get a new SIM card and local phone number.</p>\n\n    <p>Research the destination. Travelers can avoid many mishaps simply by researching their destination countries. &quot;Understanding the country&#39;s laws, weather, political conditions and travel regulations can go a long way towards an enjoyable trip,&quot; advises Julia Graft, PR manager for&#160;<a href="http://www.iflyfirstclass.com/" target="_blank" title="first business class tickets">FlyFirst</a>. &quot;The U.S. Department of State maintains briefs on more than 200 countries, so it&#39;s easy to get important, up-to-date information on foreign destinations.&quot;</p>\n\n    <p>Stay in touch. Traveling Americans should stay in contact with the State Department. Americans can submit their travel plans to the State Department&#39;s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program so that the government can contact travelers in the event of a crisis.</p>\n\n    <p>Know insurance coverage. Travelers should check with their overseas medical insurance coverage. &quot;Americans abroad should know what to do and where to go for a medical emergency,&quot; Graft says. &quot;Also, some prescription drugs may not be allowed in the destination country, so travelers should check to see what medication restrictions are in place.&quot;</p>\n\n    <p>Notify credit card companies. It&#39;s best to notify credit card companies of impending travel so that the companies&#39; fraud monitors don&#39;t inadvertently freeze credit accounts for unusual use.</p>\n\n    <p>Go to the local bank. Instead of using the money conversion centers in airports, travelers should go to a bank in the destination country. There, they can be assured of completely accurate exchanges and lower fees.</p>\n\n    <p>Avoid identity theft. Credit cards and passports are vulnerable to identify thieves using RFID scanners in busy airports and tourist attractions. Graft warns, &quot;The scanners can pick up vital information embedded in passports and credit cards just by passing in close proximity to the items, so it&#39;s important to keep them stored in a RFID-proof wallet.&quot;</p>\n\n    <p>Don&#39;t use debit cards. While abroad, travelers should use credit cards rather than debit cards. If a debit card number is stolen while abroad, the traveler&#39;s liability on any fraudulent use is $500, versus $50 for most credit cards.</p>\n\n    <p>With a little bit of planning and research,&#160;<a href="http://www.iflyfirstclass.com/" target="_blank" title="cheap last minute flights">international travel</a>&#160;can be full of exciting adventures and interesting experiences.

As the busy summer travel season approaches, FlyFirst experts offer their tips for securing inexpensive last-minute and business class flights.</p>\n\n    <p>First, less expensive last-minute flights are more readily available to those travelers who do their research. Some airlines offer getaway specials or last-minute flights on their individual websites. American Airlines, for instance, offers getaway deals for the next weekend to both international and domestic destinations. Similarly, other airlines such as United,&#160;<a href="http://www.iflyfirstclass.com/" target="_blank" title="cheap business class tcikets">Virgin America</a>&#160;and Southwest offer website deals, often within a short time frame. Travelers should remember to look at low-cost airlines such as JetBlue and Southwest.</p>\n\n    <p>To achieve the best last-minute flight savings, it&#39;s critical to be flexible on the details. Being willing to travel mid-week, early in the morning or late at night and to less-traveled airports may make a significant difference on the overall flight price. &quot;Travelers should look at flying into smaller airports near their destination,&quot; advises Julia Graft, PR manager for FlyFirst. &quot;Oakland International Airport and San Jose International Airport are both great alternatives to San Francisco International and offer equally quick access to Bay Area towns, but they are frequently less expensive.&quot;</p>\n\n    <p>When it comes to <strong>business class</strong> and <strong>first-class travel</strong>, there are several ways to save. Those looking to travel within the next few months are in luck, since one of the best ways to save on business class travel is to book travel during the height of tourist season. &quot;<a href="http://www.iflyfirstclass.com/" target="_blank" title="cheap business deals to asia">Business travel</a>&#160;often slows down during the summer months, so prices on business class seats often drop dramatically during that time,&quot; says Graft.</p>\n\n    <p>Using a travel concierge site like FlyFirstis helpful, as well, since those sites often provide <strong>discounts</strong> of up to 60 percent off retail prices, they negotiate flight ticket prices for travelers and offer price match guarantees.</p>\n\n    <p>For best prices, travel to more business-focused cities rather than tourist destinations, since there are usually more <strong>business-class</strong> seat offerings to business capitals. <strong>Business class flights</strong> to Melbourne are significantly cheaper than flights to Sydney, and traveling <strong>business class</strong> to Milan is less expensive than traveling to Rome.</p>\n\n    <p>Getting creative on travel itineraries is also important. To save the most on business-class seats, travelers should be willing to use connecting flights or even switch airlines at a connecting point, particularly for international travel. &quot;The key here,&quot; Graft notes, &quot;is to do plenty of homework to find the best deal on business travel. The rewards and savings can be well worth the time.&quot;</p>\n\n    <p>&quot;Traveling last-minute or via business class, doesn&#39;t have to break the bank,&quot; Graft concludes. &quot;If travelers follow these simple tips, lower cost last-minute and business class airfare is easily accessible even for pleasure travelers.&quot;</p>\n', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Austrian Air&#39;s new long-haul cabins, for example, feature full-flat beds with an air cushion system, built-in seat massage and extra storage/work space.</p>\n\n    <p><a href="http://www.iflyfirstclass.com/" target="_blank" title="first class business class">Cathay Pacific</a>&#160;<br />\n    At 82 inches fully extended, Cathay Pacific&#39;s business class seats are some of the longest in the industry. Width extensions offer additional hip support and the storage space provides room for knees while side-sleeping. While upright, a touch of a lever easily moves seats to provide extra comfort while working or visiting with other passengers. Privacy is extended with a cabinet door.</p>\n\n    <p>Qatar Airlines&#160;<br />\n    A four-year winner of the World Travel Awards for best business class, Qatar Airlines offers its business class travelers a mattress-topped full-flat bed, pajamas and cozy eye shades. Video screens and movie selections are large, USB ports are easily accessible and the food and beverage offerings are first-rate.</p>\n\n    <p>Oman Air&#160;<br />\n    Privacy and comfort are the trademark features of Oman&#39;s business class cabins. The long full-flat seats are enhanced with mattresses and high-quality sheets and duvets. Airbus 330 business class cabins feature just four seats across and high sides for extra privacy. Oman Air earned best business class seat, World Airline Awards.</p>\n\n    <p>Virgin Atlantic&#160;<br />\n    Full-flat beds with down duvets and full-size pillows make Virgin Atlantic&#39;s business class seats a good bet for travelers who want to sleep in-flight. Most of Virgin&#39;s aircraft have business class cabins filled with individual seat pods arranged in a unique herringbone configuration. The set-up provides direct access to the aisle from every seat.</p>\n\n    <p><a href="http://www.iflyfirstclass.com/" target="_blank" title="cheap business class fares">Singapore Airlines</a>&#160;<br />\n    Mostly known for its outstanding business class service and first-class dining, Singapore Airlines earned the 2012 World Travel Award for best airline business class. Most of the air carrier&#39;s business class seats are wide and offer comfortable, full-flat seats with mattress toppers.</p>\n\n    <p>As with any type of flight, it&#39;s important for travelers to do a little research to find the business class that best fits their particular needs. &quot;Business travelers who are flying during daylight hours may want to select a business class that offers the most work and storage space rather than worry about getting a full-flat bed,&quot; says Graft. &quot;On the other hand, business people who are flying overnight should look for airlines offering the roomiest, most comfortable beds.&quot;</p>\n', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

To help guide<strong> business travelers</strong> in planning flights, the business travel specialists at FF developed a list of the best, most efficient U.S. airports. The &quot;Top 10 Best U.S. Airports for Business Travelers&quot; list was developed by examining continental U.S. airports&#39; canceled and delayed flight rates within a 30-day period.</p>\n\n    <p>BCA&#39;s top 10 best airports for business travelers are:&#160;<br />\n    1. Rochester International (ROC)&#160;<br />\n    2. Richmond International (RIC)&#160;<br />\n    3. Buffalo/Niagra International (BUF)&#160;<br />\n    4. Port Columbus International (CMH)&#160;<br />\n    5. Memphis International (MEM)&#160;<br />\n    6. Indianapolis International (IND)&#160;<br />\n    7. Pittsburgh International (PIT)&#160;<br />\n    8. Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky (CVG)&#160;<br />\n    9. Nashville Metropolitan (BNA)&#160;<br />\n    10. Lambert-St. Louis (STL)&#160;<br />\n    HONORABLE MENTION*:&#160;<br />\n    Westchester County (HPN)&#160;<br />\n    Bradley International (BDL)&#160;<br />\n    Hancock International (SYR)&#160;<br />\n    *Ranked on departure data only, no arrival information available.</p>\n\n    <p>The airports ranking high on the list were the airports with the fewest delayed or canceled flights. Using the total number of canceled and delayed departures and arrivals for each airport, FF rated the airports with two scores: the canceled-flight score, which is the mean number of cancellations for the past 30 days and the delayed-flight score, which is the mean number of departure and arrival delays.</p>\n\n    <p>FF added the honorable mention category to acknowledge the three airports with low rates of delayed and canceled departures. FF could not average the scores or rank the three airports in the overall list because the airports lack arrival statistics.</p>\n\n    <p>The No. 1 priority of business travelers is to get to their destinations on schedule. Always focused on the business traveler&#39;s needs, FF develops its &quot;best&quot; and &quot;worst&quot; lists with that top criterion in mind, says FF Marketing Director Julia Graft. That focus applies to the Top 10 Airports list which rates each airport on the issue most important to business travelers.</p>\n\n    <p>FF is designed to provide the best possible deals for domestic business travelers, which includes determining multiple choices for air carriers, air fares and routes. Similarly, on-time departures, connections and arrivals figure into that analysis of the best options for travelers. Graft points out that the large, obvious airport is not always the best airport. If the destination is the metropolitan D.C. area, for instance, travelers might consider bypassing the crowded Dulles Airport and use Richmond Airport (RIC) instead. For travel to the New York City area, Westchester County Airport is a great alternative to the heavily used and congested JFK, LaGuardia and Newark airports. Travelers to New England should consider using Bradley International Airport near Hartford, Conn., for its simplified access instead of complicated Logan Airport in Boston.</p>\n\n    <p>The Top 10 Best Airports list is also useful in determining options for connecting flights. Using smaller Midwest airports, such as Cincinnati (CVG), Port Columbus (CMH), Nashville (BNA) and Memphis (MEM), may save time over busy airports like O&#39;Hare, where delays and cancellations are 10 times higher than at the top FF best airports.</p>\n\n    <p>Graft concludes that the FF research shows that bigger airports are not always the best choices, particularly when smaller airports may help travelers save time and deliver them to their meetings and offices on schedule. For that reason, Graft says, FF is pleased to provide the list of top performing airports for the business traveler.</p>\n', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Bicycling is a way of life here, so consider renting a bicycle to tour around town when not traveling by boat.<br />\n    <br />\n    Architecture and history buffs delight in Amsterdam&#39;s plentiful historic buildings. From its oldest, Oude Kerk, constructed in 1306 to its modern VanGogh Museum, travelers can spend days roaming the town investigating its charming buildings.&#160;<br />\n    <br />\n    Eight iconic windmills still inhabit Amsterdam. Touring all eight windmills, including the 1725-built De Gooyer Windmill, is a fantastic way to spend an afternoon.<br />\n    <br />\n    A cultural melting pot, Amsterdam celebrates its many sides in more than 50 museums, including its most famous: the Rijksmuseum and the Stedelijk Museum. For more recent history, visit the house where Anne Frank, her family and the Van Pels hid from Nazi police.</p>\n\n    <p><br />\n    True to its professed social tolerance, Amsterdam allows local coffee shops to sell small amounts of cannabis to those who are at least 18 years old. The city also allows legal prostitution, conducted in a controlled manner and in designated areas. The town&#39;s most visited red-light district is De Wallen.</p>\n\n    <h2>Travel in Luxury in Business Class&#160;</h2>\n\n    <p>Long flights to Amsterdam can be pleasurable and affordable with FlyFirst&#39;s <strong>discount business class flights and stellar first class deals</strong>.

Movie buffs from around the world travel to the city for its G&ouml;teborg International Film Festival, and tens of thousands of soccer players converge in Gothenburg each year for its Gothia Cup, the largest football/soccer tournament in the world.<br />\n    <br />\n    Gothenburg is also home to two world-class institutions: Liseburg and Volvo. Named one of the top ten theme parks in the world by&#160;<em>Forbes</em>&#160;magazine, Liseburg is home to exhilarating rides and roller coasters and a charming Christmas market. Slightly less adrenaline-inducing, Volvo offers a ride on The Blue Train through the company&#39;s Torslanda factory to see how Volvos are manufactured.</p>\n\n    <h2>Luxury Fit for a Monarch</h2>\n\n    <p>Flights to Sweden can be relaxing aboard the luscious style of first and business class cabins.

Eight large, traditional windmills are sprinkled throughout Amsterdam, helping the large city retain its picturesque charm. Whether you are visiting Amsterdam for business or pleasure, there are plenty of must-see sights to include on your itinerary. Quaint Oude Kerk is the city&#39;s oldest church, while the Church of St. Nicholas is a sprawling and impressive example of Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Baroque architecture. As testament to the city&#39;s importance to fine art over the centuries, visitors can tour the Van Gogh Museum and honor the memory of Rembrandt at his statue.<br />\n    <br />\n    Culture and commerce blend beautifully in Rotterdam, Holland&#39;s second largest city. With one of the busiest ports in the world and a robust international commercial center, Rotterdam is a bustling hub for business. Its forward-thinking nature is evident in its remarkable Erasmus Bridge spanning the Meuse River, the Euromast observation tower and the funky, symbolic Cube Houses.<br />\n    <br />\n    Known for its broad-minded attitudes and reputation for fairness, it&#39;s fitting that the Netherlands is home to the most famous international political institution in The Hague. Its beautiful Peace Palace houses the International Court of Justice and the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and it frequently hosts special international events.

Welcoming boulevards and colorfully landscaped parks here are as entrancing as the city''s rich history and trendy food and wine scenes. Adelaide’s early openness to all religions gave it its nickname, “The City of Churches.” Today, that broad-minded spirit and hospitality live on in Adelaide’s fondness for festivals celebrating art, lifestyle, food, wine and international culture. Now more commonly known as “The Festival City,” Adelaide buzzes with activity. Its Adelaide Fringe Festival alone is a month-long celebration of cabaret, film, music, visual art, dance and design. The party in Adelaide’s clean streets continues with other festivals like WOMADelaide, Adelaide Cabaret Festival, Adelaide Festival of Ideas, FEAST, Tasting Australia and Adelaide Film Festival. So many events are held in March that locals refer to the season as Mad March.\r\n\r\nThe city and its residents are also inspired by its unique location on the appealing Gulf of St. Vincent. If you’re enjoying a business class flight to Adelaide, you’ll probably get a good look at the scenic gulf as well as a peek at the picturesque River Torrens meandering through the city. The gulf’s beaches and the River Torrens provide countless recreation options for locals and visitors. Your last minute business class tickets to Adelaide are waiting!

If you’re in Barcelona on April 23, you’ll enjoy the combined Sant Jordi celebration and the city’s festival of books. You’ll see men giving women red roses, women giving men books and well-known authors hosting book-signings on the streets.
